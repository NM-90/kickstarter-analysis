# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Visualizing outcomes based on campaign launch dates and funding goals. 

### Purpose
Comparing campaign launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To understand the outcomes by launch dates, a pivot table was created by comparing the successful, failed, and canceled events to the months that they were scheduled to launch. A filter was created for the Parent Category (Category) and Years.  The outcomes were counted and the months were placed in the Row. From there, a line graph was created from the pivot table. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Louise wanted to know understand the campaigns based on their funded goals.  To compare the number of successful, failed and  canceled campaigns, the CountIF function was used.  The Sum function was used in column E to obtain the total number of projects.  Finally, the perctange formula was used to list the percentage for all 12 funding ranges.  A line graph was created from this data.  I had to manipulate the data set to get the percentage on the Y-axis and the price ranges in the X-axis.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I spent a lot of time trying to filter out months from the years/quarters.  Once I did that , I then found that you can filter out which outcomes you want.  In this case, I clicked on Column Labels and removed the Live outcome. 

On the Outcomes Based on Goal charts, I learned that you can simply change the values and leave the rest of the formula alone.  I had to go back and correct some of the values and >< characters to match the line graph image to the lesson. 



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Conclusion 1: 
Conclusion 2: 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
